cppPlot: Basic SVG/tga plotting in c++
=======

Thie purpose of this library is to enable very basic function plotting from
c++. TGA may eventually be deprecated, due to SVG being simpler and not
requiring functions to create letters/numbers.

Currently SVG supports axes and will plot functions and arrays.
